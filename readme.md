# Dolly

Dolly is a GRBL controller board that my existing "Woodpecker" GRBL controller board
will make for me.  It includes a few features that my CNC machine's stock
board did not offer including:

* JST-XH connectors for spindle, probe, and end stop connections.
* Bluetooth connectivity via an on-board HC-05 module.
* On-Board ICSP header to allow for reflashing without using USB Bootloader.
